# multiDigest
Exhaustive search algorithm written in Python solving the Multi-Digest Problem in bioinformatics.

The goal of this algorithm is to reconstruct the original restriction sites map based on the lengths of the fragments obtained after partial/complete digestion by one/multiple restriction enzymes. More information about the specific Multi-Digest Problem can be found in multiDigest_report.pdf.
